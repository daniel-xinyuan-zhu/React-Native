# React-Native
I personally believe in learning by coding and tinkering, so this repo contains a couple of apps I've either followed along or built/tinkered with myself
so I can learn various features of React Native. 

The app albums is a simple app that displays a couple of Taylor Swift albums complete with an artist photo, album cover photo, and a button which 
automatically redirects you to buying the album off Amazon when you click on the button.

More to come!
